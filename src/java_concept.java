// Object Oriented Program is super important.

/* All languages that support O.O.P have three traits in common; encapsulation, polymorphism, and inheritance.

Encapsulation:
Combines code and data together that keeps them safe from misuse and outside interference.
data and code that are combined in a way that a "Black Box" is created, in this box lies all necessary code and data.
When a code and data are linked together in this fashion, an object is created...

There are public and private parts of the object. Private meaning that the object can't be accessed by another part of
the code that exists outside the object. Public parts are where other parts of your program can access it even though
it is defined inside of a class.

Objects also have classes. A class specifies the form of the object. Java uses class specification to construct objects
Code and Data that are a part of a class is referred to as members of the class. They're referred to as member variables
or instance variables.

 Polymorphism:
 It comes from the Greek word "many forms." Think of this to be akin to that of a car's steering wheel in which
 a steering wheel is the interface. The interface (steering wheel) is the same exact no matter what car you drive.

 Another way to look at it is "One interface, multiple methods." A generic interface to group related activites.

 Inheritance:
 The process in which an object can inherit the properties of another. Inheritance supports hiearchial classification.

// With all that said got to the Example.java file and look at the sample program
